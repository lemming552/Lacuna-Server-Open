%s To Accept Help Expiring
~~~
We have %s "%1$s To Accept Help" expiring. If we wish to continue to allow these other empires to help administrate our empire during your well-deserved (and regular) vacations, you will need to renew the treaties in your profile settings.

Sincerely,

Your diplomatic corps
