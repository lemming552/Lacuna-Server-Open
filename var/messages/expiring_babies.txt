%s To Give Help Expiring
~~~
We have %s "%1$s To Give Help" expiring. To continue to offer these other empires assistance administrate their empire during their far-too-regular vacations, they will need to renew the treaties in their profile settings.

If they fail to do so prior to the expiry of the treaty, our access will be cut off with no further warning.

Sincerely,

Your diplomatic corps
